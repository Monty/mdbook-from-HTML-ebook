I wanted to experiment with  using [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook)
for a book as opposed to documentation.

I borrowed code from Eric Hamiter's [IPython mdbook](https://github.com/ehamiter/ipython-book)
to replace standard mdbook fonts and css.

I used this [Project Gutenberg eBook](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1661)
for sample content.
